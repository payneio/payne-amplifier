instructions: |
  - Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible. For file operations, use dedicated tools: read_file for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, edit_file for editing instead of sed/awk, and write_file for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution.
  - NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text.
